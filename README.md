# LEORE — Interactive Website

Built from your Stitch design (`DESIGN.md` tokens + `code.html` mockup). The
storefront now runs as a React app powered by Vite while keeping the existing
assets and visual system.

## What's inside

```
leore/
├── index.html        Vite entry point for the React app
├── src/App.jsx       React storefront, shared overlays, cart and page views
├── src/data/products.json Product catalog and image configuration
├── css/style.css     Custom styles layered on top of Tailwind (drawer, modal, toasts…)
└── package.json      Vite scripts and React dependencies
```

## Running it

Install dependencies and start the Vite development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit the URL printed by Vite, usually `http://localhost:5173`.

Create a production build with `npm run build`. The generated `dist/` folder
can be deployed to GitHub Pages or another static host.

## WhatsApp contact and ordering

Set `VITE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` in a local `.env` file to enable WhatsApp links. Copy
`.env.example` as a starting point and enter Leore's business number in
international format using digits only, including the country code (for example,
`919876543210`; do not include `+`, spaces, or punctuation). Restart Vite after
changing the setting. Do not add a real business number to source control.

The footer's **Contact on WhatsApp** link opens a prefilled general enquiry in
WhatsApp. Product quick view offers **Order on WhatsApp** for in-stock products;
choose a size and quantity first. The message includes the selected product,
formatted INR price, size, and quantity. The bag also has an optional WhatsApp
order action that summarizes its items and total. Product color selection is
not currently part of the catalog, so no color is included.

WhatsApp opens with a draft only: the customer must press **Send**, and the
request remains pending until Leore confirms availability and delivery details.
This does not create a persisted order, reserve stock, or process payment.
When the number is unset or invalid, ordering links are disabled; in Vite
development mode the storefront displays a configuration warning.

Run `npm test` to test number validation, Click-to-Chat URL encoding, contact
and order messages, and cart totals. Check the product quick view and cart at a
narrow mobile viewport with `npm run dev` to verify responsive behavior.

## What's interactive

- **Shopping bag** — add to bag from the hero product or any product card,
  adjust quantity, remove items. Persists across the home and collections views
  via `localStorage`, with a live count badge in the nav.
- **Quick View modal** — opens for any product, size selection required
  before adding to bag.
- **Collections filtering & sorting** — category tabs (All and Hoodies) and a
  price sort, both live-rendered from `products.json`. Bento tiles on the home page deep-link into pre-filtered
  views (e.g. `/?page=shop&category=Outerwear`).
- **Live search** — full-screen overlay, filters the catalog as you type,
  click a result to jump straight into its quick view.
- **Mobile nav drawer**, **scroll-triggered reveals**, a **scroll progress
  bar** in the brand's muted gold (per `DESIGN.md`'s "Interactive Progress"
  spec), and a **newsletter form** with inline validation.
- **Checkout** is a labeled demo action — no payment is processed, since
  there's no backend. Wire it up to Stripe/Shopify/etc. when you're ready.

## Editing products

Everything in the shop — home page imagery, the shop grid, quick view, and
search — reads from `src/data/products.json`. Add, remove, or
edit a product there and it updates everywhere automatically.

Product images live together in `assets/products/` and use the matching product
slug, such as `assets/products/signature-hoodie.jpg`. Change the `image` field
in the JSON when replacing product photography; homepage product images use the
same catalog automatically.

## Design system reference

Full tokens (colors, type scale, spacing, elevation, shape) are documented
in the original `DESIGN.md` you exported from Stitch — kept in this repo's
history for reference. In short: near-black surfaces, off-white type, muted
gold reserved for CTAs and status, zero border-radius throughout, Sora for
display type, Hanken Grotesk for body, JetBrains Mono for labels/prices.
